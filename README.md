# Socket Programming
 This project was made for our Computer Architecture as our final project. It is a socket chat application written with python 3. Running this application without python 3 or above might cause some issues along the way.

## Installation Guide
 Simply change the directory to the workspace and run the following command on a command prompt or powershell to start the server.

```bash
python server.py
```
Open a new command prompt or powershell to start a client. To see it working as a chat room, start multiple clients at different command prompts or powershells. 

```bash
python client.py
```

Simply chat !disconnect to disconnect a client from the server.
